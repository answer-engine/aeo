# Why AEO Matters

The way people find information is fundamentally changing. Marketing teams across all industries face two major disruptions: declining organic traffic from traditional search and the rapid emergence of AI-powered alternatives. Understanding and implementing AEO isn't optional—it's essential for businesses that want to remain visible. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Disruption 1: Organic Traffic is Declining

The data is stark. Industry analysts predict a **50% decrease in organic search traffic by 2028** due to AI-generated answers. But this isn't a future problem—it's happening now.

**Key statistics:**

- **60% of searches** in the US and Europe are now zero-click searches
- **30% of all searches** trigger AI Overviews in Google
- **74% of problem-solving queries** show AI-generated responses
- Businesses report **up to 40% drops** in organic traffic after AI Overview rollouts

### Zero-Click Search is the New Normal

When AI provides a direct answer, users don't need to click through to your website. This fundamentally changes the value equation:

| Before AI Search | After AI Search |
|------------------|-----------------|
| User searches → Clicks link → Reads your content | User asks question → Gets AI answer → May never visit |
| Success = Rankings & CTR | Success = Being cited in the answer |
| Traffic drives conversions | Citations drive authority |

## Disruption 2: New Search Platforms Are Rising

For the first time in 25 years, serious alternatives to Google exist. New AI search experiences and chatbots are capturing significant market share.

### Current Traffic Landscape

| Platform | Monthly Visits | Growth Rate |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Google.com | ~76 billion | Flat (0%) |
| ChatGPT.com | ~4 billion | 5-15% MoM |
| Perplexity.AI | ~110 million | 17-24% MoM |

**ChatGPT is now among the top 10 websites globally.** This isn't a niche tool—it's becoming a primary way people seek information.

### Market Forecasts

- The generative AI market reached **$67 billion in 2024**
- The worldwide AI search and LLM market is expected to grow **24-36% annually** through 2030
- AI agents and chatbots are projected to grow **up to 23% by 2030**

## Why You Should Invest in AEO Now

### 1. ChatGPT is a Top 10 Website Globally

Serious alternatives to Google exist for the first time in search history. Your customers—and their customers—are already using AI tools like ChatGPT to make purchasing decisions.

### 2. Traditional Search is Losing Ground

AI-powered search is becoming more popular daily. The shift isn't gradual—it's accelerating.

### 3. Lead the Way in a New Space

Like the early days of SEO, businesses that act now can establish themselves as leaders before the space becomes saturated.

### 4. Influence How AI Learns About Your Brand

AI models need time to learn. Optimizing your content early shapes how these systems understand and recommend your brand.

### 5. Build Early Authority

Simple AEO strategies can produce results now, but long-term authority wins. Starting early compounds your advantage.

### 6. Prepare for AI Shopping Assistants

AI shopping assistants will prioritize well-known, well-structured brands. Position yourself before these tools become mainstream.

### 7. Claim Top Spots in AI Results

Being mentioned first in AI responses drives more engagement. Early movers are establishing these positions now.

  </Col>
</Row>

## Impact on Paid Advertising

It's not just organic traffic that's affected. Research shows:

- **Paid CTR drops by 12%** when Google AI Overviews appear
- Both organic and paid conversions decrease with AI-generated answers
- The traditional search advertising model is being disrupted

## The Competitive Advantage of Early Adoption

Early AEO adopters are seeing significant results:

- **Higher citation rates** in AI-generated answers
- **Increased brand recognition** through AI mentions
- **Better authority signals** that compound over time
- **More resilient traffic** as AI search grows

## The Wild West is Back

The current AI search landscape feels like the early days of SEO—everyone is experimenting to find what works. However, we strongly recommend building an AEO strategy for the long run.

Some tactics will produce quick wins, but sustainable results come from:

- **Long-term brand positioning**
- **Consistent authority building**
- **Structured, high-quality content**
- **Strategic entity optimization**

> "There are no silver bullets in AEO, as there have been none in SEO. However, consistent processes with a clear goal and positioning will pay off in the long run."

## The Bottom Line

If AI-driven search engines don't recognize your brand through consistent and authoritative mentions, it simply won't be included in their responses. This isn't about gaming algorithms—it's about making your content genuinely useful and accessible to AI systems.

**The question isn't whether to invest in AEO. It's how quickly you can start.**
