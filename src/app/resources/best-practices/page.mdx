# AEO Best Practices

Proven strategies for Answer Engine Optimization based on research and real-world success stories. These best practices will help your content get discovered and cited by AI systems. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Content Strategy

### 1. Write for Questions

AI search often starts with questions. Structure content to answer them:

```markdown
✅ Good: "What is Answer Engine Optimization?"
AEO is the practice of optimizing content for AI search engines...

❌ Bad: "Introduction to AEO"
In this article, we'll explore the topic of AEO...
```

### 2. Lead with the Answer

Put key information first—AI often extracts from early paragraphs:

```markdown
✅ Good:
Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing 
content for AI-powered search engines. It differs from SEO by 
focusing on machine comprehension rather than rankings.

❌ Bad:
In today's digital landscape, search is evolving rapidly. 
Traditional approaches may not be sufficient. Let's explore
what this means for your content strategy...
```

### 3. Be Specific and Factual

AI systems prefer concrete, verifiable information:

```markdown
✅ Good:
According to industry research, 45% of knowledge workers now 
use AI search tools weekly (Source, 2025). Implementation takes
approximately 2-4 weeks for most websites.

❌ Bad:
Many people are using AI search these days. It doesn't take too
long to implement AEO on your site.
```

### 4. Cover Topics Comprehensively

Become the authoritative source on your topics:

- Cover all aspects of a topic
- Link related content together
- Update regularly with new information
- Address common questions and edge cases

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Implement Structured Data Early

Don't wait—add Schema.org markup now:

**Priority Order:**
1. WebSite and Organization schemas (homepage)
2. Article/BlogPosting schemas (content pages)
3. FAQPage schemas (FAQ content)
4. HowTo schemas (tutorials)
5. Product/Service schemas (commercial pages)

### 2. Create Comprehensive llms.txt

Include all relevant fields:

```txt
# Essential
site_name: Your Site
site_url: https://yoursite.com
site_description: Clear, comprehensive description

# Permissions (be explicit)
llm_inference: allow
llm_training: allow

# Entry points (guide AI to important content)
primary_entry: https://yoursite.com
documentation: https://yoursite.com/docs
```

### 3. Configure AI Crawler Access

Be intentional about AI access:

```txt
# robots.txt
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: Google-Extended
Allow: /
Disallow: /private/

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /
```

### 4. Optimize Page Performance

AI crawlers have limited resources:

- Page load under 3 seconds
- Minimal JavaScript for content rendering
- Clean HTML structure
- Mobile-friendly design

## Content Structure

### 1. Use Semantic HTML

```html
✅ Good:
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Main Topic</h1>
    <p class="lead">Summary paragraph</p>
  </header>
  <section id="concept-1">
    <h2>First Major Point</h2>
    <p>Details...</p>
  </section>
</article>

❌ Bad:
<div class="article">
  <div class="title">Main Topic</div>
  <div class="content">
    <div class="section">
      <div class="heading">First Major Point</div>
```

### 2. Maintain Heading Hierarchy

```markdown
✅ Good:
# Main Topic (H1)
## Section One (H2)
### Subsection (H3)
## Section Two (H2)

❌ Bad:
# Main Topic (H1)
### Subsection (H3) ← Skipped H2
## Section (H2)
#### Details (H4) ← Skipped H3
```

### 3. Use Lists for Scannable Content

```markdown
Key benefits of AEO:

- **Increased visibility** in AI search results
- **Higher citation rates** from language models  
- **Better brand recognition** through AI mentions
- **Future-proofed content** strategy
```

## Authority Building

### 1. Display Author Expertise

```html
<div class="author">
  <img src="/authors/jane-smith.jpg" alt="Dr. Jane Smith">
  <h3>Dr. Jane Smith</h3>
  <p>AI Research Lead with 10+ years experience in search systems.
     Previously at Google and Stanford AI Lab.</p>
  <a href="/authors/jane-smith">View all articles</a>
</div>
```

### 2. Cite Sources

Reference authoritative sources in your content:

```markdown
According to research published in Nature (Smith et al., 2025),
AI search usage has increased 300% year-over-year. This finding
is consistent with industry reports from [McKinsey](link) and
[Gartner](link).
```

### 3. Keep Content Current

- Add "Last updated" dates
- Regularly review and update facts
- Remove or update outdated content
- Track industry changes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Keyword Stuffing
AI understands meaning, not just keywords. Write naturally.

### ❌ Thin Content
Short, superficial content won't be cited. Go deep.

### ❌ Duplicate Content
Unique, original content gets cited. Don't copy.

### ❌ Ignoring Structure
Unstructured content is hard for AI to parse. Use headings and semantic HTML.

### ❌ Blocking AI Crawlers
If AI can't access your content, you won't be cited.

### ❌ Missing Metadata
Complete metadata helps AI understand and cite your content.

| Metric | How to Measure |
