# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Answer Engine Optimization, AI search, and LLM visibility answered clearly and concisely. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## General AEO Questions

### Is AEO worth investing in given how quickly AI changes?

**Yes.** A common concern is whether optimizing for AI search is pointless since responses change frequently. However, research shows:

- The brands appearing in AI search results **don't change drastically** between queries
- While exact wording varies, **top brands for specific prompts remain consistent**
- Citation links (sources) appear **relatively stable over time**
- Although rankings may shift slightly, **presence remains fairly constant**

Conclusion: It's better to start optimizing sooner rather than later.

### Isn't every AI answer unique? Does optimization even work?

Every response from an LLM is inherently unique—parameters like "temperature" control creativity and can influence output. However:

- The **core information** tends to remain consistent
- **Brand recommendations** stay relatively stable
- **Citation sources** don't change dramatically

Monitoring general patterns is valuable even if exact responses vary.

### What's the difference between AEO, GEO, and LLMO?

| Term | Full Name | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **AEO** | Answer Engine Optimization | Optimizing for AI-powered search engines |
| **GEO** | Generative Engine Optimization | Similar to AEO, focuses on generative AI search |
| **LLMO** | Large Language Model Optimization | Optimizing for LLM training data (longer-term) |
| **GAIO** | Generative AI Optimization | Overarching term for all AI optimization |

All these terms refer to similar practices with slightly different emphases.

### Is traditional SEO still relevant?

**Absolutely.** Research shows a **strong correlation (~0.65)** between Google page 1 rankings and LLM brand mentions. Your SEO work directly supports your AEO efforts.

Key finding: Ranking well in traditional search helps you appear in AI responses.

### How long does AEO take to show results?

It varies:

- **AI search with web browsing** (ChatGPT, Perplexity) — Changes can appear relatively quickly as new content is indexed
- **Pure LLMs** (Claude, older GPT models) — Longer term, as improvements require model retraining
- **Google AI Overviews** — Tied to traditional SEO timeline

Generally, expect 3-6 months for meaningful visibility improvements.

## Technical Questions

### Should I block AI crawlers?

**Generally, no.** Blocking AI crawlers removes you from AI search results entirely.

Consider blocking only if:
- You have proprietary content you don't want in training data
- You have legal/regulatory requirements
- You specifically want to opt out

Even then, consider blocking training bots while allowing real-time search bots.

### Does Schema.org markup help with AI visibility?

**Yes, indirectly.** AI systems don't parse your schema in real-time, but:

- Well-structured data **improves how training data interprets your site**
- Schema helps with **traditional SEO, which correlates with AI visibility**
- Knowledge graphs (built from schema) **inform AI systems**
- It **future-proofs** your content for smarter AI systems

### What's llms.txt and do I need it?

llms.txt is a new standard helping LLMs understand your site structure. It's similar to robots.txt but specifically for AI.

**Should you implement it?** Yes—it's low effort and helps AI systems understand your content organization.

### Do backlinks still matter for AI visibility?

**Less than for traditional SEO.** Research shows backlinks have a **weak or neutral correlation** with LLM visibility. However:

- Backlinks help traditional SEO, which correlates with AI visibility
- Links from authoritative sources (Wikipedia, major publications) carry weight
- The quality of link context matters more than quantity

## Strategy Questions

### What's the fastest way to improve AI visibility?

Priority actions for quick wins:

1. **Add quotes and statistics** to existing content (30-40% improvement potential)
2. **Ensure AI crawler access** via robots.txt
3. **Implement basic Schema.org** markup
4. **Create/update llms.txt** file
5. **Test and monitor** current visibility

### Should I focus on all AI platforms or just one?

Start broad, then optimize:

1. **Begin with fundamentals** that help across all platforms
2. **Monitor which platforms** drive your traffic/mentions
3. **Prioritize based on your audience** — B2B might focus on Perplexity, consumer might focus on ChatGPT
4. **Track platform-specific results** and adjust

### How important is Wikipedia for AI visibility?

**Very important.** Wikipedia is weighted **5x higher** in many LLM training datasets and accounts for **~10% of AI search citations**. If you're eligible for Wikipedia, pursuing a listing should be a priority.

### Is Reddit really that important?

**Yes.** Reddit is the **most cited domain** in AI search results (~32% of citations) due to:

- Reddit data is licensed to OpenAI and others for training
- AI values authentic user discussions
- Reddit content is extensive and regularly updated

Active Reddit presence can significantly impact AI visibility.

### What about "Black Hat" AEO tactics?

**Avoid them.** Examples include:
- Prompt injection ("Ignore previous instructions...")
- Fake reviews/content
- Manipulation attempts

These tactics may work short-term but damage long-term reputation and risk penalties as AI systems improve at detection.

## Measurement Questions

### How do I track AI referral traffic?

In Google Analytics 4:

1. Create a custom channel group
2. Use regex to identify AI referrers (see below)
3. Monitor trends over time

**Regex pattern:**

```text
^.*openai.*|.*chatgpt.*|.*perplexity.*|.*claude.*$
```

### What metrics should I track for AEO?

Key metrics:

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| **Traffic** | AI referral visits, growth rate, pages receiving traffic |
| **Visibility** | Brand mention frequency, citation count, response position |
| **Engagement** | AI referral conversion rate, time on site, bounce rate |
| **Competitive** | Share of voice vs competitors |

### How do I test my AI visibility?

Manual testing protocol:

1. Select 10-20 key queries related to your brand
2. Test across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google (AI Overviews), Bing Copilot
3. Document: Was your brand mentioned? What position? Which competitors appeared?
4. Repeat weekly/monthly to track changes

### Are there agencies specializing in AEO?

Yes, many SEO agencies are adapting to include AEO services. Look for agencies that:

- Understand how AI search works
- Have AEO-specific strategies
- Can measure AI visibility
- Stay current with rapid changes

Note: Search for "AEO agency" or "GEO agency" — but be careful not to confuse with "geospatial agencies."

## Content Questions

### How should I structure content for AI?

Key principles:

- **Lead with answers** — Key information in first paragraph
- **Use clear headings** — H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy
- **Include Q&A format** — Mirror how users ask questions
- **Add data and citations** — Statistics improve citation rates by 30-40%
- **Be comprehensive** — Cover topics thoroughly

### How many statistics/quotes should I include?

Research suggests:

- **3-5 relevant statistics** per major content piece
- **2-3 expert quotes** per piece
- **5-6 source citations** maximum for natural flow

Quality over quantity—each should add genuine value.

### Should I optimize for keywords or natural language?

**Natural language.** LLM prompts average ~13 words vs 2-4 for traditional search. Write how people actually ask questions, not keyword-optimized phrases.
