## What We'll Cover

Each case study will include:

- **Background** — Site type, industry, starting position
- **Challenge** — Specific AEO problems faced
- **Implementation** — What changes were made
- **Results** — Measurable improvements
- **Key Learnings** — Takeaways for your implementation

## Preliminary Insights

Based on early observations:

### Documentation Sites

Sites with comprehensive, well-structured documentation see high citation rates because:

- Clear heading hierarchy makes content easily parseable
- Code examples provide concrete implementation details
- FAQ sections directly answer common questions
- Regular updates keep content relevant

### Content Publishers

Successful content publishers in AI search typically:

- Use clear, factual language
- Include author credentials prominently
- Cite sources for claims
- Structure articles with Q&A sections

### E-commerce

Product pages that appear in AI recommendations often:

- Include comprehensive product descriptions
- Use structured data (Product, Review schemas)
- Provide comparison information
- Answer common buyer questions
