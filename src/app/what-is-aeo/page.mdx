# What is AEO?

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** is the process of optimizing a brand, product, or any entity to be visible in responses generated by AI searches and Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity AI, DeepSeek, and more. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## AEO Defined

AEO ensures your brand is mentioned in LLM responses based on your positioning, products, expertise, and relevant information—ranking high in those responses.

**Current visibility formats include:**
- Text-based mentions
- Citation links
- Direct quotes
- Statistics and data
- Video references
- Product recommendations

In general, AEO is a long-term process like SEO. While SEO once had more "quick wins," AEO has fewer shortcuts—at least for sustainable results.

## The Difference Between AEO and SEO

### Traditional SEO

SEO is about optimizing on-page and off-page factors. You want your website found and content showing up for keywords. People read your content to find solutions.

Traditional search engines work by:
1. Indexing website content
2. Parsing and matching to search queries
3. Displaying results as blue links on SERPs

### Answer Engine Optimization

AEO shares the same goal of being found but involves additional efforts. It goes beyond on-page and off-page optimization—it's about **fostering conversations**. You need to guide AI systems to mention your brand and engage in discussions about you.

AI-driven search relies on LLMs that learn from vast amounts of content. Using their understanding of entities, they **generate responses** rather than simply linking to pages.

> "Today's AI search engines are answering machines rather than search engines. We have to take that into account in our optimization strategies."

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect | Traditional SEO | AEO |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **Goal** | Website ranked for keywords | Brand mentioned in AI responses |
| **How it works** | Content indexed and matched | AI interprets and synthesizes |
| **Results** | Blue links on search pages | Text responses with citations |
| **Content** | Specific pages define relevancy | Your content forms entity clusters |
| **Crawlers** | GoogleBot indexes structured data | LLMs interpret content, images, conversations |
| **Optimization** | Keywords and backlinks | Semantic relationships and authority |

## Related Terms

You may encounter several related terms:

| Term | Full Name | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **AEO** | Answer Engine Optimization | AI-powered search engines |
| **GEO** | Generative Engine Optimization | Generative AI search specifically |
| **LLMO** | Large Language Model Optimization | LLM training data (longer-term) |
| **GAIO** | Generative AI Optimization | Overarching term for all AI optimization |

These terms are often used interchangeably and refer to similar practices.

## How AI Generates Responses

The responses generated by AI are **not direct reproductions** of training data. While you might see a quote or statistic from your content, the AI won't return complete articles as originally written.

Answers are **synthesized** from:
- Various articles and data sources
- The AI's internal knowledge
- Real-time web search results (for AI search engines)
- Entity relationships and semantic understanding

This is fundamentally different from traditional search, which finds matches and shows links.

## Traditional SEO Tactics vs. AEO

### On-Page Optimization

| SEO | AEO |
|-----|-----|
| Goal: Get website content indexed | Your content is a cluster of entities used to train LLMs |
| Specific content pieces define relevancy | Your website is not necessarily the destination |
| GoogleBot indexes what it can parse | LLMs can interpret content, images, videos, conversations |

### Technical SEO

| SEO | AEO |
|-----|-----|
| Website structure must make content easy to index | For AI search with web results, many traditional principles apply |
| Focus on crawlability and page speed | For pure LLMs, technical SEO is less directly relevant |
| Structured data helps parsing | Structured data influences training data interpretation |

### Authority (Off-Page)

| SEO | AEO |
|-----|-----|
| Authority influenced by backlinks and mentions | Mentions in authoritative sources matter more than link quantity |
| PageRank and Domain Authority | Entity recognition and topic associations |
| Link building campaigns | PR, Reddit presence, Wikipedia eligibility |

### User Experience

| SEO | AEO |
|-----|-----|
| Engagement metrics influence rankings (CTR, bounce rate) | For AI search, engagement factors are uncertain |
| Strong UX boosts SEO performance | Content quality and citability matter more |

## What Makes Content AI-Friendly

### 1. Clear Structure

AI parses well-organized content more effectively:
- Clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Logical content flow
- Lists and tables for data
- Summary sections

### 2. Authority Signals

AI prioritizes authoritative content:
- Expert authorship
- Credentials displayed
- Citations to reputable sources
- Comprehensive coverage

### 3. Citable Elements

Content that gets cited includes:
- Specific statistics and data
- Expert quotes
- Unique insights
- Original research

### 4. Entity Clarity

Help AI understand what you are:
- Consistent brand naming
- Clear topic associations
- Schema.org markup
- Defined relationships

## The Long-Term Perspective

> "There are no silver bullets in AEO, as there have been none in SEO. However, consistent processes with a clear goal and positioning will pay off in the long run."

While the current landscape feels like the early Wild West of SEO, **long-term brand building and authority building** will be the right strategy to succeed in the AI era.
