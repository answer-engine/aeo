# Content Structure for AEO

How you structure your content dramatically impacts how well AI systems can understand and cite it. This guide covers best practices for organizing content that AI can parse effectively. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Why Structure Matters for AI

AI systems don't just read content—they parse it. Well-structured content helps AI:

- **Identify main topics** and subtopics quickly
- **Extract key facts** for citation
- **Understand relationships** between concepts
- **Determine content hierarchy** and importance

## The Ideal Content Structure

### Basic Template

```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Main Topic Title</h1>
    <p class="lead">Summary paragraph that answers the main question...</p>
    <meta name="author" content="Expert Name">
    <time datetime="2026-01-05">January 5, 2026</time>
  </header>
  
  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Context and background...</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="main-concept">
    <h2>Main Concept</h2>
    <p>Detailed explanation...</p>
    
    <h3>Sub-topic A</h3>
    <p>Details...</p>
    
    <h3>Sub-topic B</h3>
    <p>Details...</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="practical-application">
    <h2>Practical Application</h2>
    <p>How to apply this...</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Summary and key takeaways...</p>
  </section>
</article>
```

## Heading Hierarchy

### Rules for Headings

1. **One H1 per page** — This is your main topic
2. **H2 for major sections** — Primary divisions of content
3. **H3 for subsections** — Details within sections
4. **Don't skip levels** — No H1 → H3 jumps
5. **Descriptive headings** — Should make sense out of context

### Good vs Bad Examples

```markdown
❌ BAD: Vague or Skip Levels

# Website
### Part 1     ← Skipped H2
## Overview    ← Back to H2, inconsistent

✅ GOOD: Clear and Hierarchical

## The Lead Paragraph

The first paragraph is crucial—AI often uses it for summaries:

```markdown
# What is Answer Engine Optimization?

**Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** is the practice of optimizing 
content for AI-powered search engines. Unlike traditional SEO which 
focuses on ranking in link lists, AEO ensures your content is 
understood and cited by AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and 
Google AI Overviews.

```

### Lead Paragraph Checklist

- [ ] Answers the main question directly
- [ ] Contains the most important information
- [ ] Works as a standalone summary
- [ ] Uses the main keyword naturally
- [ ] Is concise (2-3 sentences max)

## Lists and Data

AI systems easily parse well-formatted lists:

### Unordered Lists for Features/Items

```markdown
Key benefits of AEO include:

- **Increased visibility** in AI search results
- **Higher citation rates** from language models
- **Better brand recognition** through AI mentions
- **Future-proofed content** strategy
```

### Ordered Lists for Processes

```markdown
To implement AEO, follow these steps:

1. **Audit current content** for AI readability
2. **Add structured data** (Schema.org, JSON-LD)
3. **Create llms.txt** file at site root
4. **Optimize content structure** with clear headings
5. **Monitor and iterate** based on results
```

### Definition Lists

```html
<dl>
  <dt>AEO</dt>
  <dd>Answer Engine Optimization - optimizing for AI search</dd>
  
  <dt>LLM</dt>
  <dd>Large Language Model - AI systems that understand text</dd>
  
  <dt>RAG</dt>
  <dd>Retrieval Augmented Generation - AI using external data</dd>
</dl>
```

## Tables for Comparisons

Tables are highly parseable for AI:

```markdown
| Feature | Traditional SEO | AEO |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Goal | Ranking in SERP | Citation in answers |
| Focus | Keywords | Meaning & structure |
| Metric | Rankings | Citations |
| Content | Click-optimized | Comprehension-optimized |
```

## Question-Answer Format

Structure content to directly answer questions:

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best way to implement AEO?

The best approach is to start with structured data implementation,
then optimize your content structure, and finally add an llms.txt
file to explicitly guide AI systems.

### How long does AEO take to show results?

Results typically appear within 2-4 weeks as AI systems recrawl
your content. However, competitive topics may take longer.

## Semantic HTML Elements

Use HTML elements that convey meaning:

| Element | Use For | AI Understanding |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `<article>` | Main content | Primary content block |
| `<section>` | Thematic grouping | Topic divisions |
| `<header>` | Introductory content | Page/section intro |
| `<nav>` | Navigation | Not main content |
| `<aside>` | Related content | Secondary info |
| `<footer>` | Footer content | Metadata, credits |
| `<main>` | Main content area | Primary focus area |

## Content Length Guidelines

| Content Type | Recommended Length | Why |
|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| Definition pages | 500-1,000 words | Concise, focused |
| How-to guides | 1,500-2,500 words | Comprehensive steps |
| In-depth analysis | 2,500-4,000 words | Thorough coverage |
| Reference docs | As needed | Complete information |

<Note>
  Quality matters more than length. A concise, well-structured 800-word article outperforms a rambling 3,000-word piece.
</Note>
