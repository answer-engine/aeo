# Schema.org & JSON-LD for AEO

Schema.org markup may not be glamorous, but ignoring it is like showing up to a networking event without business cards. While AI systems don't directly parse your schema in real-time, structured data significantly influences how your content is understood and cited. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How Schema Actually Works with AI

### The Reality

ChatGPT isn't sitting there parsing your website's schema in real-time. But here's what actually happens:

**1. Training Data Quality**
When AI models get trained on internet data, well-structured content gets understood correctly. Poorly structured content is harder to interpret accurately. Search engines leverage Schema Markup and knowledge graphs as data sources to train machines.

**2. Search Integration**
As AI tools browse the web in real-time, they look for clear, structured information. AI Overviews trigger for 15-30% of all queries and reach more than 1 billion global users monthly. Schema is your content wearing a name tag.

**3. Knowledge Graphs**
Big tech companies use schema to build their knowledge databases—and that's what AI systems reference when they need facts.

## The Numbers Behind Schema

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Websites using Schema | 45+ million domains |
| Schema objects on web | 450+ billion |
| Sites on Google page 1 with schema | 72% |
| Rich result CTR vs standard | 58% vs 41% |

## Schema Types That Matter for AEO

### Organization Schema

Tells AI systems you're a real company:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Your Company Name",
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com",
  "logo": "https://yourdomain.com/logo.png",
  "description": "What your company does",
  "foundingDate": "2020-01-01",

  },
  "sameAs": [
    "https://twitter.com/yourcompany",
    "https://linkedin.com/company/yourcompany"
  ]
}
```

### Article Schema

For content pages—tells AI you know what you're talking about:

```json
{

  "datePublished": "2025-01-01",
  "dateModified": "2025-01-05",
  "mainEntityOfPage": "https://yourdomain.com/article"
}
```

### Product Schema

Helps AI recommend your products:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product description",
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "Your Brand"
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "99.00",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.5",
    "reviewCount": "100"
  }
}
```

### FAQPage Schema

Positions you as the go-to expert for questions:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is AEO?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing content for visibility in AI-powered search engines and LLM responses."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does AEO matter?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "AEO matters because AI search engines are rapidly growing, with ChatGPT now among the top 10 websites globally."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Review Schema

Provides structured social proof:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Review",
  "itemReviewed": {
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": "Product Name"
  },
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Reviewer Name"
  },
  "reviewRating": {
    "@type": "Rating",
    "ratingValue": "5",
    "bestRating": "5"
  },
  "reviewBody": "Review content here"
}
```

### HowTo Schema

For instructional content:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "How to Implement AEO",
  "description": "Step-by-step guide to AEO implementation",
  "step": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Audit current visibility",
      "text": "Test your brand visibility across AI platforms"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Implement structured data",
      "text": "Add Schema.org markup to your pages"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Use JSON-LD Format

JSON-LD is the recommended format for structured data:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "Page Title"
}
</script>
```

**Why JSON-LD:**
- Cleanly separated from HTML
- Easy to generate programmatically
- Doesn't affect page rendering
- Preferred by Google

### 2. Validate Your Schema

Use these tools to check your markup:
- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)
- [JSON-LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/)

### 3. Keep It Accurate

Schema must match visible content:
- Don't markup hidden content
- Prices must be accurate
- Reviews must be real
- Authors must be genuine

### 4. Implement Server-Side

**Do this:**
```html
<!-- In your HTML template -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {{ jsonLdSchema | safe }}
</script>
```

**Not this:**
```javascript
// JavaScript-injected schema may not be crawled
document.write('<script type="application/ld+json">...');
```

## Prioritizing Schema Implementation

### Priority 1: Foundation

- Organization schema on homepage
- WebSite schema on homepage
- Article/BlogPosting on all content

### Priority 2: Enhanced

- FAQPage for FAQ content
- HowTo for instructional content
- Product for product pages

### Priority 3: Advanced

- BreadcrumbList for navigation
- VideoObject for video content
- Event for events
- LocalBusiness for local SEO

## Should You Bother? (Yes)

### The Case for Schema

**It's insurance:** When AI gets smarter (and it will), you'll be ready

**Competitive moat:** Only 72% of sites on Google's first page use schema markup

**Search benefits:** 58% of users click on rich results vs only 41% for regular results

**Professionalism:** Well-structured data demonstrates technical competence

### The Uncomfortable Reality

Schema isn't going to magically make ChatGPT mention your startup in every conversation. Current AI models don't directly read your markup in real-time.

But structured data:
- Makes your content machine-readable
- Improves how training data interprets your site
- Supports traditional SEO (which correlates with AI visibility)
- Future-proofs your content

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Invisible Content Markup

Don't mark up content users can't see.

### ❌ Fake Reviews

Schema for non-existent reviews is spam.

### ❌ Wrong Schema Types

Using Product schema for a service, or Article for a product page.

### ❌ Duplicate/Conflicting Schema

Multiple conflicting schemas confuse parsers.

### ❌ JavaScript-Only Schema

Schema injected via JavaScript may not be seen by AI crawlers.
