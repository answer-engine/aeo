# Reddit Strategy for AEO

Reddit has become one of the most important platforms for AEO. A significant portion of LLM training data comes from Reddit, and it consistently ranks as the top cited domain in AI search results. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Why Reddit Matters for AI Search

### Training Data Licensing

Reddit has licensed its user-generated content to OpenAI and other AI developers. This means Reddit discussions directly influence how LLMs understand topics, brands, and recommendations.

### Citation Dominance

Studies analyzing AI search responses found Reddit is the **most cited domain** in AI-generated answers:

| Domain | AI Citations |
|--------|--------------|
| **reddit.com** | **3,212** |
| youtube.com | 1,047 |
| en.wikipedia.org | 961 |
| linkedin.com | 630 |

**Nearly one-third of cited results** influencing LLM responses originate from Reddit domains.

### Why AI Trusts Reddit

1. **Authentic discussions** — Real users sharing real experiences
2. **Upvote validation** — Community-vetted content rises to the top
3. **Detailed responses** — Long-form answers with nuance
4. **Updated information** — Active discussions reflect current opinions
5. **Diverse perspectives** — Multiple viewpoints on any topic

## Reddit Strategy for Brand Visibility
