```

This is consistent with earlier work by [Researcher] who 
demonstrated [related finding].
```

- **Don't over-cite** — maintain readability

| Government data | Very High | Very High |
| Major news publications | High | High |

## Content Enhancement Strategy

### Step 1: Identify Key Claims

After: "AEO is becoming critical for businesses, with research 
indicating that 40% of marketing teams are now exploring AI 
optimization strategies."
```

### Step 2: Add Supporting Statistics

For each key claim, find a relevant statistic:

```markdown
Claim: AI search is growing rapidly.

Supporting statistic: ChatGPT traffic has grown 5-15% 
month-over-month, while Perplexity.ai sees 17-24% MoM growth.
```

### Step 3: Include Expert Quotes

```markdown
Claim: The future of SEO is changing.

Expert quote: "The future of SEO is about mentions, authority, 
and AI relevance. Here's how to secure brand visibility in 
AI-generated search results."
```

### Step 4: Optimize Readability

Ensure enhanced content still flows naturally:

- Citations should be integrated smoothly
- Overall readability should remain high

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Unsourced Statistics

```
*No source, not specific, not citable*
