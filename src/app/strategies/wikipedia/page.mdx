# Wikipedia Strategy for AEO

Wikipedia holds a privileged position in LLM training data and AI search citations. A Wikipedia presence isn't just nice to have—it's a significant advantage for AI visibility. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Why Wikipedia Matters for AI

### Training Data Priority

LLM training data consists of Wikipedia with **higher priority** than most other training data. In the standard training corpus:

| Source | Proportion | Weight |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Common Crawl | 60% | 1x |
| WebText 2 | 22% | 5x (boosted) |
| Books | 16% | 1x |
| Wikipedia | 3% | 5x (boosted) |

Despite being only 3% of training data by volume, **Wikipedia is weighted 5x higher** than standard web content.

### Citation Frequency

Studies of AI search results show Wikipedia consistently appears among top cited domains:

| Domain | AI Citations |
|--------|--------------|
| reddit.com | 3,212 |
| youtube.com | 1,047 |
| en.wikipedia.org | 961 |
| linkedin.com | 630 |

Wikipedia was responsible for **nearly 10% of all citation links** in AI-based search engine results.

## The Wikipedia-Knowledge Graph Connection

Once listed on Wikipedia, your brand often appears in **Google's Knowledge Graph**, which provides additional benefits:

- Knowledge Graph data is structured and AI-friendly
- It helps LLMs understand entity relationships
- It provides verified, authoritative information
- It establishes your brand as a recognized entity

## Requirements for Wikipedia Listing

Wikipedia has strict guidelines. Not every business qualifies, but understanding the requirements helps you work toward eligibility.

### 1. Notability

Your brand must be recognized as a significant entity. This requires:

- **Independent mentions** in news articles
- Coverage in **books or academic papers**
- **Interviews** in notable publications
- **Third-party recognition** (not self-published)

### 2. Verifiability

All claims must be backed by reliable, third-party sources:

✅ **Acceptable sources:**
- Major news publications
- Academic journals
- Books from established publishers
- Industry reports from recognized firms

❌ **Not acceptable:**
- Press releases
- Company blogs
- Self-published content
- Social media posts

### 3. Neutral Point of View

Content must be:

- **Unbiased** — No promotional language
- **Factual** — Stick to verifiable facts
- **Encyclopedic** — Written objectively
- **Balanced** — Include criticisms if notable

### 4. Conflict of Interest

**If you're the owner or marketer, don't edit the article yourself.**

Wikipedia has strict conflict of interest policies:

- Use the article's **"Talk page"** to suggest changes
- Provide proper sources for any suggestions
- Let neutral editors make the actual edits
- Disclose your affiliation when discussing

## Building Wikipedia Eligibility

If your brand isn't currently notable enough for Wikipedia, work toward eligibility:

### Step 1: Generate News Coverage

- Pursue media coverage in recognized publications
- Focus on newsworthy activities (launches, research, achievements)
- Build relationships with journalists in your industry

### Step 2: Industry Recognition

- Win industry awards
- Participate in conferences and events
- Publish research or reports
- Contribute to industry publications

### Step 3: Third-Party Mentions

- Encourage customer case studies in publications
- Seek analyst coverage
- Get mentioned in academic research
- Build citation-worthy content others reference

### Step 4: Document Everything

Keep records of all notable coverage:

- URLs with publication dates
- Screenshots (in case articles are removed)
- Archive.org links for permanence
- Full citations in proper format

## Maintaining Your Wikipedia Presence

Once you have a Wikipedia page:

### Monitor for Changes

- Set up alerts for edits to your page
- Watch for vandalism or negative edits
- Monitor the Talk page for discussions

### Keep Information Current

- When verifiable facts change, propose updates
- Always provide new sources for updates
- Don't edit directly—use Talk page

### Expand Coverage Appropriately

- As your company grows, new sections may be warranted
- Major milestones can be added (with sources)
- Subsidiary or product pages may become appropriate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Creating Your Own Page

Wikipedia editors will quickly identify and potentially delete pages created by the subject. This can result in your brand being flagged.

### ❌ Promotional Language

Using marketing speak like "industry-leading" or "innovative" without third-party sources will get content removed.

### ❌ Citing Your Own Website

Self-citations are not considered reliable sources for Wikipedia.

### ❌ Removing Negative Information

If notable criticism exists and is well-sourced, attempting to remove it violates Wikipedia policy.

## Alternative: Wikipedia Mentions

If you can't have your own page yet, aim for mentions on related pages:

- Industry overview pages
- Technology or methodology pages
- Location-based pages
- Founder or key person pages

Mentions on other Wikipedia pages still contribute to AI understanding of your brand.

## Measuring Wikipedia Impact

Track:

- **Referral traffic** from Wikipedia
- **Brand searches** that trigger Knowledge Graph
- **AI mentions** correlating with Wikipedia content
- **Entity recognition** in structured data tools
