## 🌍 Why This Project Exists

**AI search is transforming how people find information faster than anything we've witnessed.** ChatGPT is now a top 10 website globally. Google AI Overviews appear in 30%+ of searches. Perplexity is growing 20%+ month-over-month.

Traditional SEO resources can't keep pace with this change. That's why we built AEO.dev as an **open, community-driven knowledge base** where practitioners can:

- Share what's actually working in AI search optimization
- Document strategies, techniques, and findings
- Learn from each other's experiments and case studies
- Cite sources and build collective knowledge

**This space is moving too fast for any single person or company to keep up. We need the community.**

---

- **AI Search Engine Deep Dives** — How ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude work
- **Optimization Strategies** — Content structure, quotes & statistics, Schema.org, llms.txt
- **Authority Building** — Wikipedia strategies, Reddit engagement, PR approaches
- **Technical Implementation** — Robots.txt, crawlers, structured data, performance

This knowledge base exists because:
